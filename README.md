**Github **
Go to your web browser and searach up github.com.
Once you're on the site you can make an account. If you're a student register as a student and give the information they ask for. That way you can benefit from the perks they offer
Making a GitHub account is the most crucial part of this whole process. You will need it later on to link it with WebStorm

**Git**
Next  major step is to downlond Git. If using windows choose the correct bit file. If you don't know what bit your computer is running on, go to settings-->about. You will see system type and it'll display if your computer is a 32 or 64 bit computer.
After choosing the correct file, set up the prefernces you like.

**Webstorm**
Webstorm should the be installed. Go to jetbrains.com/webstorm/ . Then you'll see a download option. Once you see that, install it.
Make an account for Jetbrains.
If possible, use your student email to access all of the perks for this as well. You will get a product key. Copy that and keep it somewhere because that key gives you access to the account benefits
Once installed set up your preferences.
Now we must link Webstorm to to GitHub. You must press CTRL+ALt+S. That will open up the settings page. Once that is opened, you go to Version Control, then you will see GitHub. Click that and you will see Add Account in the center. click that and you must click on "log in via GitHub"
You will then have to sign in to your GitHub account once again. It'll ask you if you Authorize JetBrains. You must accept that for WebStorm to link with your GitHub account.
